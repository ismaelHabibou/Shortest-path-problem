# Shortest-path-problem
	I have solved the shortest path problem using the divide and conquer approach which is quite straight forward compared to implementing Dijkstra (I am not familiar with graph theory).
  
This solution can be improved in number of ways for example:
1.	Using heap sort or merge sort to sort my points instead of selection sort.
2.	Using an array instead of a list to store my points
3.	Implementing Dijkstra (I promised I will implement it next time)
